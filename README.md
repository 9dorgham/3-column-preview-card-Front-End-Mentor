I am a beginner in programming, I am sorry if there are too wrongs in my code I got a problem here My problem is I got a problem to align the items vertically it just happen when I display it on smaller devices like phones. I used auto-fit to make a responsive design without @media Queries. If you have any way to fix this I would be grateful you help me to improve my skills. Thanks

**Notice:-**  
I know that I can do this design with flex box ,but as you know I won't use @media Queries in my project.
